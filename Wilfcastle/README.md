How To Add A Faction
--------------------

1. Make a copy of the "loyalists-modified.cfg" in the "factions" directory.
2. In this new file, change the "id" to something unique. (You'll probably
want to change the "name" too)
3. Add the line "{~add-ons/Wilfcastle/factions/YOUR_FACTION_FILE.cfg}" to the
"Wilfcastle_eras.cfg" file next to the one for the "loyalists-modified.cfg".
4. Test that your faction has been added to multiplayer mode.

Adding Additional Units
-----------------------

Please make sure units have unique IDs from all other units.
You will need to add any additional directories in the units
directory into the main.cfg (See the monsters folder as an example).
