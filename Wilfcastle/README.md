How To Add A Faction
--------------------

1. Make a copy of the "loyalists-modified.cfg" in the "factions" directory.
2. In this new file, change the "id" to something unique. (You'll probably
want to change the "name" too)
3. Add the line "{~add-ons/Wilfcastle/factions/YOUR_FACTION_FILE.cfg}" to the
"Wilfcastle_eras.cfg" file next to the one for the "loyalists-modified.cfg".
4. Test that your faction has been added to multiplayer mode.
